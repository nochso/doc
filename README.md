## What is it? 
As the name suggests, it's a *fast* and simple PHP blogging app created mainly for developers. 
You can use fastpress to publish your github pages, or run simple vanilla php blog. 

#### Using Github pages
This solution involves integrating your github pages to publish the content in your site using fastpress. 

##### Using Database 
This is the simple wordpress-esque way to publish your blogs. Just log in to your fastpress app, and start blogging. 

## Features: 
 - Fastpress uses `prism.js` for syntax hightlighting (over 50 languages)
 - Font-awesome and bootstrap for easier front-end customization 
  - This might contradict the focus on speed. Bootstrap can be neat, but maybe we should go with normalize and create our own, more semantic CSS? I mean less divs/classes and more styling of HTML5 elements like `<article>`.  
  Makes customizing a lot easier instead of trying to fit everything into bootstrap IMO.
 - Disqus for commenting. (optional vanilla php comment feature)
 - Multipe user accounts for authoring blogs
 - Fetch/order blogs by unique tags, dates and authors
  - Defining this should be probably be the next task along with the database model.
 - *editable* blogs by visitors, edits then are sent as PR to your github account. 
 - log in with github/twitter to comment. 
 - easily embed gists and tweets into your blog post
